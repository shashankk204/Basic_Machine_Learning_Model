# ML BOOTCAMP

This is a library containing different machine learning models like linear regression , polynomial regression , logistic regression , KNN and Neural Network

ALL the models are coded in form of Classes and Function stored in ML_BOOTCAMP file 

Have showcased how to use the ML_BOOTCAMP library in the given Jupyter-Notebook(ML_BOOTCAMP.ipynb)

have also applied some of concepts of machine learning for obtaining better output


## System Requirements
1)Python 

2)NumPy

3)Pandas

4)Matplotlib
## Output

Output from the given test data is stored by the name == predicted_<ML model used>.csv

stored the Output with ids and predicted_label as columns

linear regression is trained on linear_train.csv
polynomial regression is trained on polynomial_train.csv
KNN,Logistic and Neural Neural is trained on classification_train.csv 
## TO-DO

- Have to improve accuracy of neural network
